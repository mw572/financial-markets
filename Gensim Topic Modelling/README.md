#Gensim Topic Modelling

Using raw data from a [previous project](https://github.com/mw572/financial-markets/tree/master/Whitepaper%20Research/The%20financial%20press%20and%20stock%20markets%20in%20times%20of%20crisis) where I scraped news headlines from the WSJ. 
I built a handful of topic models based on deep belief Neural Network architecture and lightly explored concepts with Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency and Latent Semantic Indexing.

Due to lack of high quality data this served as an experiment rather than generating a useful asset for further exploration. A much large dataset is required of a much higher quality to dig into underlying relationships.

Previous work from others that has yielded an model which is barely able to return simple relationships trained on Google News was gigabytes in size vs my dataset that was less than a gigabyte, but far more concentated in concepts.
