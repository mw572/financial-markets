##Neural Network S&P 500 forecast project

I experimented with NNet framework to look at its predictive power in calling the directional change of the S&P 500 indexin the following week considering current data and lagged data snippets. Click [here](https://github.com/mw572/financial-markets/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Analysis/Neural%20Network%20-%20Time%20Series%20Prediction.ipynb) for the final Notebook.

I found inspiration from various pay for services and papers such as [this](http://www.if5.com/_AboutIFS/!Downloads/A_Trading_System_for_FTSE-100_Futures.pdf). However I was realistic with my level of competency regarding networks and time restrictions, this piece is a very shallow dive into a deeply interesting field.

Covered in notebook:
* Importing data
* Artificial Neural Network implementation 
* Price action indicators & technical indicators
* Fear & Greed indicator 
* Accuracy examination useing cross validation

**I am looking to utilise the simple model created in this project with some algorithms that I am developing to give a directional bias for specific strategies such as momentum traders.**
